## Scrum Project Management Backend (.NET)

Backend application built with **.NET** for a Scrum project management system.

The project provides APIs for managing Scrum resources such as projects, project members, sprints and tasks, with **resource-based authentication and authorization** to control access to individual entities.

The application is designed as a service-oriented backend and serves as the foundation for a frontend application (e.g. Vue.js).
